## Hey there! 

I build real-world web apps and software, leveraging LLMs and modern AI tools to accelerate the development.
> **Strong Logic + Modern AI = Fast Delivery**
---

### Builder Mindset
> *If it’s boring, automate it. If it’s hard, debug it with snacks.*

* **Ship Fast:** I use AI to handle boilerplate so I can focus on **Architecture**.
* **Solve Hard:** Turning LeetCode struggles into optimized solutions.

---

###  Currently
* Building **AI-Native Web Apps** that solve specific problems.
* Grinding **DSA** & **System Design**.
* Trying not to deploy on Friday.

> **Code is never finished, just committed.**
